# Work Tree

Work tree is a way of understanding the work you're doing and where it's leading you by providing an interactive tree where items are unlocked as you complete work.

The work tree can be customized to your workflow and you can use a slew of community built "meters" that measure your work across code editors, websites, and more.

## Building a Work Tree

**Every new user's workspace should begin with "Master Work Tree" tree**. This will keep you on track to finish your "real" work trees.

A work tree is composed of "meters". Meters measure something, such as number of code commits, number of posts, or website traffic. Automatic meters are meters that automatically update their progress for you, **always use automated meters if you can.** Some meters are a checkbox (e.g. "Attend a Code Conference").

To make the most engaging work tree possible, try to make progression happen frequently, that is, you should be able to unlock about 2 blocks in a normal work day. Some people will prefer to unlock more or less. Notice when you don't want to work, you probably don't have a good block.

## Modifying Work Trees

It's not a good idea to modify work trees in progress because it gives you a "cheat code" to winning. Still, sometimes you're working towards a hopeless or too easy tree, maybe it was too ambitious or perhaps you didn't know the true bounds of your productivity!

A couple ways to mitigate this problem:

- If your tree is too easy, expand the tree, no harm done!
- Change your trees weekly, archive old ones and construct new ones that represent your goals for the week

## Shared Work Trees

Work trees can be a way to keep a team motivated and get everyone on the same page about the progress of team.

## Creating new Automated Meters

Automated Meters are simple to build for web programmers, basically you just run a single HTTP API endpoint that accepts a JSON object of credentials or details then output a JSON array of meters. [Read more about building Automated Meters](#).

## Motivation

I was examining the relationship between playing video games and working on software/marketing tasks. I noticed that I could play a video game for 16 hours and eagerly return to my desk in the short breaks I took. But working, I could barely do a consecutive 8 hours and dreaded returning to the desk to struggle through another problem.

I believe a key factor in this was the perceived lack of progression in work. "Grind" video games with technology trees and achievement systems give the player a sense of long-term and short-term tasks and vision, as well as a freedom to choose the next steps.
